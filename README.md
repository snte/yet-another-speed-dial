# yet-another-speed-dial

A modern speed dial for Firefox and Chrome, inspired by Opera

- Respects your privacy. Unlike other speed dial addons, there is no tracking.
- Automatically generates thumbnails and screenshots, or select your own.
- Uses the browser's native bookmarks library so speed dials can be synced.
- Sortable with drag and drop
- Folder support
- Simple and fast UI
